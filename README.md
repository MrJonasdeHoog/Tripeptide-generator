### Advancments
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI to make the project more user-friendly. Users could interact with the functionalities through buttons, input fields, and graphical representations.
2. Extended Amino Acid Database: Expand the amino acid database to include additional information such as molecular weights, pKa values, and side chain properties.
3. Peptide Bond Visualization: Create a feature to visualize the peptide bond formation in the combined chemical structures. This could be particularly helpful for educational purposes.
4. Secondary Structure Prediction: Implement algorithms or tools to predict the secondary structure of peptides or proteins based on their amino acid sequences.
5. Bioinformatics Integration: Integrate bioinformatics tools or APIs to provide additional biological information about the amino acids, such as protein domains, functions, and structural properties.
6.Chemical Properties Calculator: Include a tool to calculate various chemical properties of peptides, such as isoelectric point, net charge, and hydrophobicity.
7. Amino Acid Modification Support: Allow users to include modified amino acids in their sequences and calculate the modified combined chemical structures.
8. Web Application: Convert the project into a web application to enable users to access the functionalities through a web browser.
9. 3D Structure Visualization: Implement a tool to visualize the 3D structures of peptides or proteins based on their amino acid sequences.
10. Advanced Tripeptide Generation Rules: Enhance the tripeptide generation to include more advanced rules or constraints, allowing users to customize the generated sequences.
11. Error Handling and Validation: Improve error handling and validation mechanisms to provide informative messages to users when input data is incorrect or incomplete.
12. Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of the functions and modules within your project.
13. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation, including usage examples, API references, and explanations of algorithms used in the project.
14. Integration with External Databases: Integrate with external databases or APIs that provide additional information about amino acids, peptides, or proteins.
